<h2 align='center'> ABOUT </h2>
<p>I created this Number Guesser Program using Javascript, HTML, CSS - The premise is that you play against a computer trying to guess the number that will be generated.</p>
  
<p>Once it has loaded, it presents the user with 2 boxes side-by-side, computer and user. The user then needs to enter a number on the right, out of 10 and press 'make a guess'.</p>
  
  The computer will then make a random guess and a random number will be generated. The closest one to the randomly generated number gets a point.
  
  <h2 align='center'> HOW TO USE </h2>
  
  - Fork this repo to your local device, open the index.html file on your supported browser.
  - Enter a random number from 1 to 10.
  - Press 'Make a guess'.
  - You will get a point if your guess is closer to the randomly generated number.
  - Press 'Next round' to play again.
